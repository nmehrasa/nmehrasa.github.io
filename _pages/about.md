I am a third year Ph.D. student in computer science at  [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html). I am supervised by Prof. [Greg Mori](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/). I did my  MSc in the same university. Prior to that, I recieved my BSc degree in computer science from [Amirkabir University](http://aut.ac.ir/).

My research is in computer vision and machine learning, with a particular interest in time-seris data modeling and generative models. You can find my latest CV [here](cv.pdf).
