I am third year Ph.D. student in computer science at  [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html). I am supervised by Prof. [Greg Mori](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/). I did my  MSc in the same university. Prior to that, I recieved my BSc degree in computer science from [Amirkabir University](http://aut.ac.ir/).
